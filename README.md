###### datenkrake with weekendHACK-Theme

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install
```
Meanwhile, create a `mail.config.json` and a `config.json`, based on the sample files. After that:

```bash
# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# or build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

```

__Secure the `/admin` and `/api/event/users` routes via your web server.__
