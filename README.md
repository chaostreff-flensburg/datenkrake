## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install
```
Meanwhile, create a mail.config.json and a config.json, based on the sample files. After that:

```bash
# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# or build for production and launch server
$ npm start

```
